/**
 * @fileoverview Application-wide publish/subscribe event bus.
 *
 * Design patterns: Singleton + Observer
 *   - Singleton  -- there is exactly one EventBus in the entire application.
 *     Every module that needs to publish or listen to events imports the
 *     same instance (the default export).  The class itself is also exported
 *     so that tests can access {@link EventBus.getInstance} directly.
 *   - Observer   -- components register interest in a named event type by
 *     passing a callback to {@link EventBus#subscribe}.  When any other
 *     component calls {@link EventBus#emit} with that same type, every
 *     registered callback is invoked with the emitted payload.
 *
 * Architectural role
 *   EventBus is the nervous system of Otto.  It is the ONLY channel through
 *   which the core layer (ShapeStore, ParameterStore, TabManager, etc.)
 *   notifies the UI layer (CanvasRenderer, PropertiesPanel, ShapeLibrary)
 *   that something has changed.  Neither side holds a direct reference to
 *   the other; they are coupled only through event-type strings.  This makes
 *   it straightforward to add new UI panels or new data stores without
 *   modifying existing code.
 *
 * Error isolation
 *   Each callback is invoked inside its own try/catch.  A bug in one
 *   subscriber's handler will be logged to the console but will not prevent
 *   the remaining subscribers from being notified.
 *
 * @module events/EventBus

     *
     * ── Parameter events ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
     * @property {string} PARAM_CHANGED       A parameter's numeric value was
     *     changed (e.g. the user moved a slider in the PropertiesPanel).
     *     Payload: {@code {id, parameter, oldValue, newValue}}.
     * @property {string} PARAM_ADDED         A new parameter was created in
     *     the ParameterStore (e.g. the user clicked "Add Parameter").
     *     Payload: the Parameter object.
     * @property {string} PARAM_REMOVED       A parameter was deleted from the
     *     ParameterStore.  Payload: {@code {id}}.
     *
     * ── Shape lifecycle events ───────────────────────────────────────────
     * @property {string} SHAPE_ADDED         A shape was inserted into the
     *     ShapeStore (typically via drag-drop or paste).
     *     Payload: the Shape object.
     * @property {string} SHAPE_REMOVED       A shape was deleted from the
     *     ShapeStore.  Payload: {@code {id}}.
     * @property {string} SHAPE_MOVED         A shape's position was updated
     *     via ShapeStore.updatePosition().
     *     Payload: {@code {id, shape, oldPosition, newPosition}}.
     * @property {string} SHAPE_SELECTED      The selection state changed
     *     (single or multi).  Payload: {@code {id, shape, selectedIds}}.
     * @property {string} SHAPE_UPDATED       A shape's non-position property
     *     was mutated (general-purpose; emitted when no more specific event
     *     applies).  Payload: {@code {id, shape}}.
     * @property {string} SHAPE_HOVERED       The shape under the mouse
     *     pointer changed.  Payload: {@code {shapeId}}.
     *
     * ── Tab / scene events ───────────────────────────────────────────────
     * @property {string} TAB_SWITCHED        The user clicked a different tab,
     *     or a tab was closed and the active tab changed automatically.
     *     Payload: {@code {tabId, tab}}.
     * @property {string} TAB_CREATED         A new tab was created.
     *     Payload: {@code {tab}}.
     * @property {string} TAB_CLOSED          A tab was closed.
     *     Payload: {@code {tabId}}.
     * @property {string} SCENE_LOADED        An entire scene (all tabs) was
     *     restored from a saved file.  Payload: the restored data object.
     * @property {string} SCENE_SAVED         The scene was serialised and
     *     written to persistent storage.  Payload: the saved data object.
     *
     * ── Viewport events ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
     * @property {string} VIEWPORT_CHANGED    The user panned or zoomed the
     *     canvas.  Payload: {@code {x, y, zoom}}.
     *
     * ── Node-graph / expression events ───────────────────────────────────
     * @property {string} NODE_LINK_CREATED       A link was drawn between two
     *     nodes in the expression graph.
     * @property {string} NODE_LINK_REMOVED       A link was deleted.
     * @property {string} NODE_MODULE_EDITED      A node's internal code was
     *     edited by the user.
     * @property {string} NODE_PARAM_CREATED      A new parameter node was
     *     added to the graph.
     * @property {string} NODE_EXPRESSION_CHANGED An expression text was
     *     modified.
     *
     * ── Edge selection / joinery events ──────────────────────────────────
     * @property {string} EDGE_SELECTED           The set of selected edges
     *     changed.  Payload: {@code {edge, edges}}.
     * @property {string} EDGE_HOVERED            The edge under the pointer
     *     changed.  Payload: {@code {edge, position}}.
     * @property {string} EDGE_JOINERY_CHANGED    Joinery metadata was set or
     *     updated for an edge.  Payload: {@code {edge, joinery}}.
     * @property {string} SELECTION_MODE_CHANGED  The global selection mode
     *     toggled between 'shape' and 'edge'.  Payload: {@code {mode}}.
     *
     * ── Editor-sync events ───────────────────────────────────────────────
     * @property {string} CODE_EXECUTED       User code in the CodeEditor was
     *     run.

     *     CodeEditor changed.
     * @property {string} BLOCKS_EXECUTED     A block-based program in the
